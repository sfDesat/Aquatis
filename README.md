## **Aquatis Scrap Retrieval Program**

**Objective:** Secure valuable scraps from the bunker complex on Aquatis.

**Status:** Reports indicate scattered scraps within the bunker complex on Aquatis, located on a small island.

**Terrain Analysis:**
Aquatis, primarily a water planet with scattered islands, offers a relatively safe environment compared to other company issued landing locations. The island features greenery in the form of bushes and palm trees. A beached ship and hatches around the island mark points of interest for exploration.

**Hazards:**
- **Bunker Complex:** The bunker complex, located underneath the island, is the primary target for scrap retrieval. While the exact contents are unknown, reports suggest potential hazards within, with uncertainty regarding the nature and severity.

**Surrounding Environment:**
-  **Big Birds:** Some large birds inhabit the island and may pose a threat if cornered or encountered in large groups. Exercise caution during interactions.
-  **Stonegiants (Uncertain):** Rare and uncertain reports suggest the occasional presence of stonegiants. Although potentially dangerous, encounters with these creatures are exceptionally rare and unconfirmed.

**Conclusion:**
Aquatis presents a significantly less hazardous environment compared to other company issued landing locations. Focus on the retrieval of scraps from the bunker complex on the small island. Exercise caution with the local wildlife, particularly the big birds. Success in this mission relies on strategic navigation and efficient retrieval within the bunker.
